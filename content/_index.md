A cross-government group has worked together to create a toolkit for assessing and communicating uncertainty.

This toolkit sets out good, not best, practice, as analysis and communication must always be tailored to the audience and decision being made.

The toolkit is presented in the first instance as a suggested set of guidelines and we will be consulting with experts from Government, the academic community and other external bodies to develop thinking in line with the latest evidence on communicating uncertainty.


## Toolkit contents

1. [**Introduction**]({{< ref "introduction">}})<br>This chapter motivates undertaking analysis of uncertainty and outlines the content of following chapters.
2. [**Jointly agreeing how uncertainty should be used**]({{< ref "introduction">}})<br> Before conducting any uncertainty analysis, it is important to check that you understand how the analysis will be used. What type of decision is being made? Are you informing a debate or a final decision? This will frame how you approach the analysis and how you communicate it to your customers.
3. [**Defining and identifying uncertainty**]({{< ref "defining_and_identifying_uncertainty">}})<br>
Considering the whole system that influences your analysis helps identify all possible areas where uncertainty can arise. Ensure you understand what is causing the uncertainty in your inputs and outputs, and whether this can be quantified.
4. [**Mitigating uncertainty**]({{< ref "mitigating_uncertainty">}})<br> Once uncertainty has been identified it should be reduced where possible. We outline techniques for mitigating uncertainty in a variety of analytical contexts.
5. [**Understanding and measuring uncertainty**]({{< ref "introduction">}})<br> Before conducting uncertainty analysis, you should consider the range of possible techniques. We provide a list of the most common techniques with some examples for reference.
6. [**Presenting uncertainty**]({{< ref "presenting_and_communicating_uncertainty">}})<br> There is little point conducting any analysis if it has no impact, so this is perhaps the most important section. It is important to engage with your decision makers so they take account of uncertainty in any decisions they make. 
7. [**Communicating uncertainty**] <br> When communicating uncertainty, you should think about how you interact with the audience, tailoring your communication to different groups. This will help them to understand the consequences of uncertainty and why they should be interested in it.
8. [**Conclusion**] <br> A summary of the key messages from the previous pages.
9. [**Case Studies**]({{< ref "case_studies">}})<br> A collection of case studies showing the toolkit's chapter in action.
10. [**Further reading**]({{< ref "further_reading">}})<br> A collection of useful resources including toolkits and guides from other government departments.
