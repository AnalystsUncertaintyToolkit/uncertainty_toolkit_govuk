We now consider how to choose what messages about uncertainty we should communicate to decision makers and give advice on how to communicate those messages effectively. A wealth of additional information can be found in the [GSS Communicating Quality, Uncertainty and Change guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/)

When reporting findings from any research and analysis, it is important to be transparent about the strengths, limitations and any bias in the research process as well as the findings

Research or analytical reports should include sufficient and appropriate information about the research process, any sources of uncertainty and the steps that have or could be taken to mitigate this. Where possible it is also good practice to make other materials and outputs from the research available either through publication or upon request to enable others to better understand the context and process by which the research was conducted.

The implications of sources of uncertainty on how results should be interpreted and used in decision-making and policy development should also be communicated.
