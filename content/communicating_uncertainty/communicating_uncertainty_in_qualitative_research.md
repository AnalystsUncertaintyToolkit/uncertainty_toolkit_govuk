The key principles of presenting and communicating uncertainty outlined in this section of the toolkit are also applicable when working with outputs from qualitative research. The only exception to this is the use of numeric data when presenting qualitative research findings. This is generally not considered good practice due to the small sample sizes and diverse make-up of the population.

## Recap of key principles

* Be transparent about the strengths, limitations and bias in the research process and their implications for the findings.
* Decide what to communicate: start by deciding what to communicate, and consider what decision-makers must, should, or could know.
* Present caveats: focus on those which will have the biggest impact on and implications for the decision.
* Understand the audience: when writing for or presenting to non-analysts it is important to use plain English and avoid jargon. When analysis is being used to inform a decision, results should be framed with the decision in mind.
* Consider the reporting format: the level of detail and options for how to present findings and uncertainty will depend on the required communications format – e.g. submission, report, presentation, oral briefing.

The remainder of this subsection includes guidance on how to communicate uncertainty when presenting findings from qualitative research.

## Communicate uncertainty in research design

[Section 3](ADD LINK) of the toolkit details the main sources of uncertainty for qualitative research. These include: a lack of representativeness of the population and sub-groups within it, potential biases due to researchers’ subjective judgements in the process of recruitment and analysis, and differences in how research participants engage with the research process.

When reporting findings from qualitative research it is important to be transparent about the limitations, bias and uncertainty in the research design and the implications for how findings should be interpreted and used in decision-making.

Particular attention should be given to the rationale for the sample design and the judgements made when setting quotas and deciding on the number of participants recruited. The latter is especially important when it has not been possible, due to resource constraints, to undertake fieldwork until thematic saturation has occurred. Failure to do so means it is not possible to state that the findings are conclusive, and no new themes, insights or perspectives are likely to emerge. Including the rationale for and implications of the selected approach to data collection and the analysis is also beneficial.

It is also good practice to include the research tools (e.g. screening questionnaire and topic guide) in an annex. Although it is not common practice to share full details of the analysis process and tools used, including high level information about this could be beneficial to demonstrate the level of rigour applied.

## Avoid presenting numbers

As sample sizes in qualitative research are usually small and the research predominantly uses open and exploratory questions, it is not appropriate to report fractions, percentages or proportions when reporting findings. Instead use descriptive terms such as ‘few’, ‘many’, ‘majority’ to denote prevalence of an issue or finding. This will prevent misinterpretation or inappropriate use of data. There is software that can support management and analysis of qualitative data. This can be especially helpful when dealing with large volumes of narrative data and when analysis is being undertaken by a team of researchers. This software can be used to add codes to qualitative data and to count the number of times particular words or themes are expressed. However, this analysis can take findings out of context and be misleading. Whilst it may be useful to use these functions to support interrogation of qualitative data as part of the analytic process, it is not appropriate to use the numeric outputs when communicating and presenting findings. Finally, it is unlikely that uncertainty in qualitative analysis can be quantified. Whilst some endeavours have been made to do this within natural scientific fields, application has not been extended to the social sciences where it is usual to present uncertainty in narrative terms.

## Avoid making generalisations

Qualitative research findings will only ever be reflective of the views, behaviours and perceptions of the individuals participating in the research. Whilst these findings may be indicative of the attitudes and behaviour of the wider population they cannot be presented as representative. Whilst it may be possible to make generalisations about the wider population from the data and to create typologies or personas to exemplify the research findings, it is not possible to extrapolate findings to or make inferences about the population at large. When reporting findings, be up front about whether and how far statistical inference is valid and avoid inferring from one group to another.

## Contextualise illustrative examples

You can use quotations, vignettes and case studies to bring qualitative findings to life and increase resonance and depth of understanding of a particular issue or viewpoint. When doing so it is important to ensure that they are set in context within the report, so it is clear what they are trying to illustrate. This mitigates the risk of misattribution, misinterpretation and misuse of these tools by the audience. It is especially important if it is expected that research findings will be used to support other communication activities.

## Triangulate and validate data

Grounding qualitative findings in existing evidence can demonstrate the extent to which the new findings support or contradict previous theories and the likely reasons for this. This can be an effective way of reinforcing key messages to the audience, as well as mitigating uncertainty. Other data can include past qualitative and quantitative studies, a review of wider literature, as well as new quantitative research to test the prevalence of qualitative findings within the wider population.

If further research is required to validate new qualitative findings and determine if they can be generalised to the wider population, it is worth highlighting this to decision-makers. This will mean they understand the limitations of the current research and it can be used as well as how it can be strengthened.
