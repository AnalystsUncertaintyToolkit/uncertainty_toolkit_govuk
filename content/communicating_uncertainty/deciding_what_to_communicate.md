Decision makers may be more comfortable with certain messages, which could make communicating uncertainty a difficult task. However, [research into the effects of communicating uncertainty around numbers](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913678117) suggests that being upfront about uncertainty doesn’t undermine trust in the analysis or the professionalism of the analyst, so we should be unapologetic about uncertainty as part of the analytical advice needed to inform better decisions.

You should also consider the onward communication of your message to ensure that when your work is passed on to others its core message and integrity are maintained. Consider what decision makers must, should, or could know.

Decision makers are usually more comfortable with certain messages. This can make communicating uncertainty a difficult task. Decision makers can react adversely when faced with uncertainty, leading them to lose confidence in analysis. When uncertainty is large, decision makers may feel that the analysis is of no use.

A handy phrase to remember is “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. All analysis will be uncertain because every model is a simplification of reality. However, that does not stop them from being useful. Models allow us to better understand a system and uncertain results can help identify important features of that system.

If uncertainty means that a straightforward conclusion is not possible, focus your communication on what the uncertainty analysis can tell you. This may be the key factor that drives overall uncertainty or a greater understanding of how features of a system interact.
