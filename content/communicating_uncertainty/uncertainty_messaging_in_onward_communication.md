A key challenge that you will face when trying to communicate uncertainty messages is ensuring that the integrity of these messages is maintained when they are communicated onwards, beyond your immediate client. What we are trying to avoid here are situations in which your uncertainty message becomes "distorted" as it passes from client to client. This often manifests itself as important uncertainty information or other caveats being removed from the message, leaving only central numbers persisting in information exchanges.

## Defining the problem

We can define the problem of message distortion using the following terms:

* Immediate Client: Any individual/group that receives information directly from you whether this is verbally or from reading your publication. This group will receive your uncertainty message in its purest form.
* Secondary Client: Any individual/group that receives your uncertainty message through an immediate client and not verbally from you or from reading your publication. This group is not guaranteed to receive your uncertainty message in its purest form and instead may receive a distorted version depending how effectively it is communicated to them by your immediate client.
* Message distortion: A situation where a secondary client receives an incorrect version of your uncertainty message from an immediate client. Note that this framework largely deals with cases of misinformation only in which the sharing of inaccurate information is inadvertent. Detailed guidance on disinformation, the deliberate creation/sharing of false information, can be found in the [RESIST](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/publications/resist-2-counter-disinformation-toolkit/) toolkit.

The challenge is to limit the extent of message distortion in the information exchange between your immediate and secondary clients.

## Understanding your immediate clients

When passing uncertainty messages to be communicated onwards, it is important that you consider who your immediate clients are, how they are likely to convey your message and whether you are likely to communicate with them again. We can condense the attributes of your immediate client as falling into two core characteristics:

* Ambiguity: This is the extent to which you are unsure that your analytical message will be passed on accurately to secondary clients.
* Accessibility: This is the degree of contact that you have with your immediate client i.e. Is this someone who you sit in meetings with on a daily basis or an anonymous social media user that you are never going to meet in person?

<strong>Table A: The Ambiguity/Accessibility Matrix</strong>

| Ambiguity/Accessibility  | High Accessibility | Low Accessibility | 
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <strong>Low Ambiguity</strong> | Case A: Low Ambiguity, High Accessibility | Case B: Low Ambiguity, Low Accessibility |
| <strong>High Ambiguity</strong> | Case C: High Ambiguity, High Accessibility | Case D: High Ambiguity, Low Accessibility |

Examples of immediate clients:

* Case A: Low Ambiguity/High Accessibility - A trusted policy colleague who you have worked with for many years. In this situation it is likely that simply maintaining a good relationship is all that is required for them to pass on your message accurately.
* Case B: Low Ambiguity/Low Accessibility - A well-respected figure in academia that works in a similar field to your work, likely to appreciate uncertainty messages in releases but has a lower level of accessibility due to being outside of the organisation.
* Case C: High Ambiguity/High Accessibility - A policy colleague who has little analytical/statistical background and has shown little desire to embrace uncertainty messages in the past and instead prefers to present a "clearer" message without any of the necessary caveats.
* Case D: High Ambiguity/Low Accessibility - A anonymous user on twitter who reads a tweet that features your publication, you have no knowledge of who the immediate client is in this situation and so there is a large amount of ambiguity combined with minimal accessibility.

## Tailor your actions depending on the nature of your immediate client

The set of possible responses when communicating uncertainty in analytical messages can be thought of as falling into three categories:

* Communication: Actions related to the way in which you communicate with your immediate client.
* Content: Actions concerning what is communicated to the immediate client.
* Continuity: Any actions to support and follow-up on any initial communication to the immediate client.

<strong>Table B: Action Matrix</strong>

| Ambiguity/Accessibility | Communication | Content | Continuity | 
| -------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------|
| <strong>A. Low Ambiguity/High Accessibility</strong> | No change needed from an established method of communication that is known to work <br><br> If possible, increasing the amount of onward communications that go through this person would be an effective way to make use of a relationship with a reliable contact. | No change is needed in terms of what content is communicated, given that there is confidence that uncertainty in analysis will be sufficiently communicated forwards.<br><br> More detailed and nuanced uncertainty messages can be given to this client, due to a low level of ambiguity combined with high accessibility. | It is important that this good relationship (an appreciation of each other's perspectives and needs) is maintained. A high level of accessibility should make this easy to do so.|
| <strong>B. Low Ambiguity/Low Accessibility</strong> | Due to infrequent contact, there should be some verbal component when passing information as this gives the opportunity to clear up any misunderstandings immediately rather than in the future by which point a distorted message may have already been passed to several secondary clients. <br><br> Asking clarifying questions at this stage is a good way to ensure that uncertainty messages have been interpreted as intended. | Due to a low level of ambiguity, content is likely to be communicated onwards accurately as long as it is initially interpreted correctly i.e., the risk of disinformation is low. <br><br> Therefore, while more focus should be placed on effective communication, the complexity of any uncertainty messages should be made appropriate to the level of expertise of your immediate client in order to ensure they are interpreted in the desired manner. <br><br> There is evidence ([Ribeiro et al. 2019, pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09197.pdf)) to suggest that summarising key information is an extractive way (by sub selecting key phrases), as opposed to abstractive summarisation (using paraphrasing), is a more effective way of preventing distortion when information is cascaded. | A clear progression for this type of action is to take steps to increase accessibility. This is largely done through developing a relationship with this party. <br><br> This could take the form of more regular meetings to discuss common interests or establishing a feedback mechanism on the outcomes of previous communications.
| <strong>C. High Ambiguity/High Accessibility</strong> | High accessibility means that securing face-to-face/verbal contact isn’t likely to be an issue. <br><br> Instead of simply viewing the individual/group as being untrustworthy, it is important to understand their motivations for the way in which they view uncertainty messages. This will allow you to anticipate any message distortion.| Focusing on cases of misinformation, a lack of regard for uncertainty messaging often stems from a lack of knowledge on why these caveats are important. <br><br> As a result, more emphasis should be placed on why it is important these uncertainty messages are communicated onwards, not just what messages need be communicated. | Importance of communicating uncertainty can be stressed by pointing colleagues towards relevant materials, such as the GSS guidance on [Communicating Quality, Uncertainty and Change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/). <br><br> Take opportunities to ensure that your message is communicated appropriately at critical moments e.g. Some departments have run trials in which analysts sit with Press Officers on the day of a publication release to help field any questions. |
| <strong>D. High Ambiguity/Low Accessibility</strong> | Social media still very important in broadcasting to a wider audience however, it is clearly very difficult to control how an anonymised recipient uses this information. As such, the focus here should be on ensuring that the correct analytical message is presented on whatever platform the information is circulated on. <br><br> Maintaining a “sign-off” on any information released relating to analysis is helpful to ensure that the right information is communicated. <br><br> In all cases, it is again a useful exercise to anticipate potential ways in which uncertainty messages may be distorted in onward communication. There are several examples of publications including graphics outlining what the output can and can’t be used for. | "Tightness" of message is crucial in this scenario. Clear and unambiguous messaging leaves as little room for distortion as possible. <br><br> There is evidence from the field of health that exaggeration in news is strongly correlated with exaggeration in press releases ([Sumner et al. 2014, pdf](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/349/bmj.g7015.full.pdf)). Therefore, maintaining accuracy in any form of press release is important. <br><br> Accompanying releases on these platforms with links to “explainers” written in plain-English will mitigate misinformation spread to some extent. <br><br> The [GSS Communicating Quality, Uncertainty and Change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) guidance offers advice on how to successfully communicate information to users when under character limits imposed by platforms such as Twitter. | Responses to your release can be monitored to flag any common misconceptions that emerge. Subsequent FAQ communications can then be released to tackle these. <br><br> Keeping track of the volume and type of responses is also useful in determining what dissemination platforms are effective in communicating uncertainty messages. |

## Underlying themes

A number of themes sit behind the set of actions outlined in the Action Matrix. These are additional factors that apply to all of the scenarios outlined by the Ambiguity/Accessibility Matrix:

### Understanding who your clients are and how they use your analysis 

In all contexts, it is important to try to understand how your client plans to use this analytical information and what their motivations are. Studies show that people selectively seek out information that is consistent with their prior beliefs and sometimes process this more fluently than information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs. The client’s pre-existing beliefs or attitudes towards you, the topic or object of uncertainty might influence the effects of any uncertainty communication and, in turn, how the client passes this information onward ([van der Ples et al. 2019](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.181870#d3e2087)). Therefore, in order for uncertainty to be communicated effectively, messages should be tailored to clients depending on knowledge of these factors.

### Guiding your clients on how to use your analysis 

[An inquiry into the governance of statistics (pdf)](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubadm/1820/1820.pdf), published in July 2019, by the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) produced a recommendation that government statisticians ‘should do more to guide users how to use their statistics, explain how they are typically used, outlining their strengths and weaknesses, providing commentary and advice’ (point 46). Applying this to all analysis, even when information is passed onward from the most accessible and least ambiguous client, the onus is on you to ensure clarity of message, something which is greatly aided by this type of communication.

### Client Expertise/Knowledge
The complexity of uncertainty messaging in all contexts needs to be tailored towards the level of expertise of your client i.e., their ability to correctly understand and use the information. Providing messages to a low-expertise client that are too complex carries the risk of them accidentally distorting the information due to a lack of knowledge, irrespective of ambiguity/accessibility levels. Conversely, delivering an overly simplified message to a high-expertise client represents a missed opportunity to communicate more nuanced uncertainty messages.

### Communicating uncertainty within the presentation of analysis 

Uncertainty caveats can be embedded directly into analysis in a variety of ways, for example, by presenting figures with confidence intervals. It then requires a deliberate action from the immediate client to remove this information, whereas it would be much easier to deliberately or accidentally drop footnotes or other contextual information that is not embedded into the analysis.
