Analysis is based on a model of the real word. Whether we are looking at statistics about the past, measurements of the present, or forecasts of the future, there will always be a degree of uncertainty in the outputs.

Making decisions using uncertain information can be uncomfortable – decisions would be far easier if we knew for sure what the consequences of each choice would be – but this is an unavoidable position, so analysts aspire to provide honest and practical advice on uncertainty.

This uncertainty can be critically important to any decisions based on the analysis, as ‘best estimates’ are generally not enough to make an informed decision. For example, Option A may appear better than Option B when looking at the most likely outcome of each, but if the uncertainty in A is greater than in B then it might carry an unacceptable chance of much worse outcomes. 

The presence of uncertainty in analysis may not always inspire confidence, but the absence of uncertainty is even worse. Since uncertainty is ever-present, omitting it from analysis leaves it unacknowledged and unassessed. It could be of any size, leaving the true range of possible outcomes entirely unknown. A proper assessment of analytical uncertainty, considering the limitations in data and methodology, as well as the inherent randomness in the world, is needed in order to provide an honest assessment of the range of possible outcomes – rather than presenting misplaced confidence in an impossibly accurate estimate.

Decision makers have a critical role working with analysts to agree what the analysis should focus on in relation to the decision being made (for example, a range around an estimate may be less useful than understanding what the percentage take up should be a policy for the policy to be a benefit), helping to identify sources of uncertainty, discussing how the results inform the decision being made.

This toolkit is designed to provide guidance to analysts on how to incorporate uncertainty analysis into their work, as well as setting out some high level advice to decision makers, so they know what to expect when commissioning analysis and interpreting analytical results.

This toolkit has set out good, not best, practice, as analysis and communication must always be tailored to the audience and decision being made.
