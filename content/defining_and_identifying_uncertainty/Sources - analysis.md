An additional, but important source of analytical uncertainty is in the analysis itself. With verification and validation of models, good Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA) practices can help identify the restricted uses of analytical outputs and help minimise the possibility of errors. However, mistakes can still be made, so being clear with decision makers about the extent to which analysis has been quality assured can help them understand how far they may rely on analytical results in support of their decision making. Please see the [AQuA Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government), [AQuA Book resources](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/aqua-book-resources) and [BEIS QA tools and guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/quality-assurance-tools-and-guidance-in-decc) for more information.

Carrying out adequate quality assurance is an important way to ensure sources of uncertainty have been sufficiently mitigated. Ideally, the AQA should be carried out throughout the project - before, during and after the analysis to inform at all stages. The AQA process should involve checking the analyst has done the following, for example:

- Considered why the methodology is appropriate to solve the analytical problem or answer the research question
- Considered why the analysis is appropriate for the type of data collected
- Understood the data that will be used in the analysis, including main sources of potential error and limitations of the data/analysis
- Analysed and interpreted the data in a consistent way
- Made it clear how analytical constructs e.g. categories, classifications, typologies etc. have been developed
- Ensured all interpretations are well supported by the data, accurately reflecting the meanings assigned by the participants


Note that these steps should also be applied for quality assurance of both quantitative and qualitative research. More information on AQA of qualitative research is included in [mitigating uncertainty in qualitative research]({{< ref "/mitigating_uncertainty" >}}).
