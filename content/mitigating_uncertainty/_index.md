Once uncertainty has been identified it should be reduced where possible. In this chapter, we outline techniques for mitigating uncertainty in a variety of analytical contexts.

In the first section we address mitigating uncertainty in quantitative data analysis, where we cover topics such as missing data, false positives and synthesis. Subsequent sections have more of a social research focus, presenting mitigation strategies in the context of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation methods, survey research and qualitative research and covering topics such as counterfactual comparison, questionnaire testing and standardisation of research tools and processes.
