An important consideration in experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation methods is whether the counterfactual and intervention group are comparable. This depends on the collection of comparable data from both the intervention and control groups to ensure you can measure the intervention effect. In addition, the intervention effect must be large enough to be distinguished from noise in the data. Details of how to design a counterfactual for quasi-experimental and experimental studies can be found in the [Magenta Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-magenta-book).

Where it is not possible to run an experimental study to measure impact, you should select a quasi-experimental method based on the availability of a comparison group. Details of which methods are appropriate for different situations are explained in section 3.5 of the [Magenta Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-magenta-book).

Where no comparison group is available, as in the case of analysing the impact of a global event like the COVID-19 pandemic or 2008 economic crisis, you can use an interrupted time-series approach. However, this is only appropriate where changes are sudden. This approach option is preferred to binary before-after comparisons which can be misleading as they present data out of the context of underlying trends.
