There are three main ways to mitigate uncertainty when conducting and using qualitative research: standardisation, validation and transparency.

Standardisation of tools and process can help to minimise uncertainty. Steps should be taken to facilitate consistency in approach throughout the research process - from participant recruitment, through to fieldwork (interviews and focus groups), analysis and reporting. The exceptions to this is where the researcher is intended to be part of the research process, and their perspective is a key output (e.g. where they play the role of participant observers or immerse themselves in a culture), or where there are ethical considerations that need to be considered to ensure participant welfare. Standardisation is considered in the sections: 'Research tools', 'Outputs' and 'Analysis' below.

A range of techniques can be used to validate qualitative findings. We discuss analytic induction, data triangulation, respondent validation and analytical quality assurance below.

Transparency is important for public trust and to build confidence in research findings. Transparency is covered in the last section, 'Analytical quality assurance'.

## Research tools

It is common practice to produce and use standardised research and analysis tools, and to provide briefings to team members about how they should be applied. For example, it is usual to produce a script and questionnaire for recruiters to use to screen participants. This ensures that all potential respondents are asked the same questions in the same format and in the same order to determine their eligibility to participate in the research.

It is also usual for all researchers undertaking fieldwork to follow a standard topic or discussion guide. These can vary in style and level of detail depending on the nature of the study and researcher preferences, but provide instructions for how interviews should be completed including the order in which topics should be discussed, the approximate length of time to spend of each topic and key questions or probes that should be asked to all participants. The level of flexibility that researchers have in using the guide should be agreed up front, and the aims and objectives of the research emphasised so all involved are aligned and clear about how the project should be delivered.

Where possible, researchers other than the lead researcher should aim to observe at least one interview or focus group before undertaking fieldwork so they are familiar with how the topic guide is used in practice. Likewise the lead researcher could observe the first session facilitated by another member of the team to ensure consistency in approaches. A short debrief should be provided after the first interview to discuss any issues or proposed changes required to the discussion guide before further fieldwork takes place. Additional checkpoints during fieldwork should be built into the project plan to review progress and consider if any further tweaks to the discussion guide should be made. All of these measures will help to improve consistency across fieldwork and minimise researcher bias.

## Outputs

The main sources of data produced via qualitative research are written outputs. These can range from brief notes taken by the researcher during or immediately after fieldwork - including references to key themes discussed, short quotes, and observations and reflections of the researcher - to full verbatim transcripts which include every pause, ‘umm’ and ‘ah’. Where possible audio or video recordings of interviews and focus groups should be made to facilitate recall. These should be transcribed and used as a supplement to the researcher’s notes. Where this is done, a consistent format should be used. To further reduce uncertainty where audio or video recordings have been made, a second transcriber or observer can be tasked with quality assuring transcripts and notes to ensure all relevant information is captured and recorded accurately. Doing so reduces the risk of bias in interpretation or selection of data and provides all researchers in the team with access to data produced via each interview or focus group.

## Analysis

Where a team of researchers are involved in conducting the fieldwork and analysing and reporting the findings it is important to establish a common approach to analysis up front. It is common practice to use analysis software such as NVivo or MAXQDA, or even a simple spreadsheet. Regardless of the preferred analytical tool being used, the process can be expedited and facilitated by setting out expectations of how data should be organised and managed before commencing analysis, establishing a common set of labels or codes that can be applied to the data during analysis, and agreeing points to review and refine the approach.


## Analytic induction

One of the most common theoretical methods used in qualitative data analysis is Grounded Theory. This is based on the idea that hypotheses about our data should be generated by or ‘grounded in’ the data itself rather than developed prior to data collection and analysis. The process of generating and testing these hypotheses is analytic induction. This involves systematic interrogation of the data. Hypotheses are generated during analysis and tested on a small number of cases in the sample and then refined or reformulated until all cases fit and all data has been used. Whilst this process is time and labour intensive, and can be complex, it can help to reduce uncertainty by focusing on those things that are consistent or universal within the data and ensuring that no evidence is overlooked or set aside.

## Data triangulation

One way to sense-check or validate qualitative research findings and potentially reduce uncertainty is to consider the extent to which they align with findings from other sources of evidence, a process known as triangulation. This could include findings from other similar qualitative studies, or a review of the wider evidence base.

It is also common to adopt a multi-method approach to data collection within one study to be able to look at the same phenomenon from different perspectives. For example, a study could employ multiple qualitative methods - interviews and observation. By doing so the researchers may seek to sense-check what they observe with participants’ motives or perceptions of their own behaviour. Another approach commonly used is mixing qualitative and quantitative methods in the same study, using a survey of a wider sample of respondents to test the validity of qualitative findings.

The key assumption behind data triangulation is that if you look at the same phenomenon in different ways and generate similar findings or conclusions then there is greater reliability and less uncertainty. Whilst there is value in this approach and it can provide greater confidence in research findings, it should be treated as a way of providing greater breadth, richness and rigour to the research rather than a means to provide a complete or ‘true’ picture as qualitative research by nature involves some level of interpretation.

## Respondent validation

One way to minimise the risk that the researcher has misunderstood or misrepresented the research participant’s perspective is respondent validation. This is particularly useful when undertaking ethnographic research or generating case studies. The researcher will seek confirmation that their findings and perceptions match with the views of those who participated in the research by sharing their work with them and inviting feedback. This technique is particularly important in instances where research participants will be identifiable in the findings (e.g. where respondents have agreed to be used in a case study or organisations have agreed to be named in a report) to ensure they are content with how they are being represented.

However, it is worth being mindful that one of the key purposes and strengths of the research process is to observe social phenomena - to look upon it from an external perspective. The researcher or research team plays a key role in this. By asking respondents to check and correct the researcher’s interpretation of the social world, it privileges the respondent’s view of their actions which does not necessarily increase the validity of findings. There are, of course, times where research is designed to be respondent-led - whereby the respondent acts as the researcher and may even interview and observe their peers as well as provide insight into their own lives. Where this is not the case, the decision to seek respondent validation of research findings should be considered carefully and alongside the role of the researcher in the research process.

## Analytical quality assurance

As outlined in [mitigating uncertainty in quantitative data analysis]({{< ref "/quantitative_data_analysis" >}}), steps applied to quality assuring quantitative data are also relevant to quality assuring qualitative research.

Although the AQUA book does not specifically outline suggestions for AQA of qualitative research, it should be subject to the same attention to best practice and quality assurance in its design and analysis as model building and quantitative analysis. Check whether your department has created its own guidance for conducting qualitative AQA (for example, this exists in the Home Office).

To facilitate rigorous AQA, a complete audit trail should be kept recording decision points made and outputs produced at all key stages in the research process. This includes details about how the research problem or questions were defined at the outset; the approach to sampling and recruitment selection; research tools; copies of any notes, transcripts, audio-visual materials or other materials generated through the research (e.g. respondent diaries, journals or scrapbooks); and decisions regarding data analysis (e.g. theoretical approach, coding framework). AQA can take place during the research process as well as its conclusion. AQA reviewers act like auditors, checking that appropriate procedures have been followed and considering the extent to which theoretical inferences are credible and defensible. Consequently, AQA of qualitative research can be quite a demanding and resource intensive exercise. Whilst it can help to reduce uncertainty, analysts should keep proportionality in mind when deciding how and when it can best support the research process.

Being transparent about how the research and analysis was conducted builds confidence in the findings. As noted above, maintaining a clear audit trail can help to mitigate uncertainty by facilitating peer review and scrutiny of the research process and its findings. When reporting findings from qualitative research it is important to be transparent about both the limitations and bias in the research design and the implications for how they should be interpreted and used. See communicating uncertainty in qualitative research for further details. When doing so it is important to reiterate the role and purpose of qualitative research and that findings are not intended to be representative of or generalisable to the wider population.
