Before communicating your analysis you must consider who your audience is, why they should be interested in your work, what they know already, and what key message you need to convey to them to make their decision. People respond differently to different communication methods. It is good practice to always use Plain English, avoid analytical jargon with non analysts, and frame your results in terms of the decision being made and how it is useful for them. 

If it is a group or individual you have worked with before tailor the method to what has worked well in the past (or ask them or see how they respond to different formats). A good relationship with your decision maker will help you to choose the right communication approach for them. It will also help you to understand their motivations and the implications of uncertainty for their decisions.

Be conscious of how your analysis may be used in future communication. No matter how carefully you communicate the uncertainty to your immediate client, there is a risk that uncertainty will not be communicated upwards and that only the central numbers will persist, and important caveats will be excluded. This can also occur when writing part of a larger document â€“ you need to ensure the key messages about uncertainty survive the drafting process.

A good relationship with colleagues will minimise this risk. Work collaboratively to ensure that colleagues understand why central numbers could be misleading and in which situations it would be inappropriate for them to be communicated on their own. Always ensure that wherever possible you have sight of further communication before it is sent.

In evaluations, analysts have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure that findings from quantitative analysis are used appropriately and not misconstrued and must be clear about the level of confidence in findings, taking account of the level of uncertainty and generalisability. For some methodologies it is particularly important to ensure that audiences understand limitations and the implications for use in policymaking; for example, where analysis relies solely on limited datasets or where there is ecological fallacy (discussed in [defining and identifying uncertainty](UPDATE LINK).

If presenting results to a non-analytical audience, bear in mind that they may find statistical measures of uncertainty difficult to interpret. Consider other visual methods such as a BRAG (blue/black, red, amber, green) rating scale that communicates your confidence in the results.
