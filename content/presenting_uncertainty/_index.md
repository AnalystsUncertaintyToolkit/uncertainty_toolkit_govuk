Graphs and visualisations are an excellent way of communicating the outputs of analysis, and many graph types allow you to communicate uncertainty within the graphic (provided the uncertainty has been quantified).

Unquantified uncertainties cannot generally be included in graphs, so will need to be communicated through other means (e.g. a risk log and/or assumptions log).

Some types of graphs are not particularly well suited to displaying quantified uncertainty, though this does not preclude their use if they are the most useful way to communicate a core message. You would need to find other ways to communicate uncertainty if using these chart types.

- Some simple graphs e.g. Pie charts, donut charts and stacked charts, may not always be useful when presenting uncertain analysis as they only show a single value for each data point. People can also find it difficult to compare angles or sizes of different sections.

- Avoid more complex graphs e.g.Heat and choropleth maps, treemaps, Sankey diagrams, as it can be difficult to communicate uncertainty in very information dense visualisations. There is not space to include the necessary extra information among the colours of heatmaps, the densely packed rectangles of Treemaps or the detailed flow lines of Sankey diagram.

## Decide what level of detail to include on uncertainty

You may have the full understanding of the underlying probability distribution, or just a range within which we expect the result to fall. You may choose to only include the uncertainty due to a single dominant uncertainty, or the outputs from a range of scenarios.

For representing numerical uncertainty, scatter plots with 2-dimensional error bars, line graphs with a range, bar or line graphs with error bars and single point graphs with error bars can be useful when representing an uncertain range. Box plots or box plot series can be useful when representing summary statistics. Probability (or Cumulative) Distribution functions are helpful if you have full knowledge of the distribution around a result.

For representing uncertainty due to alternative scenarios, multiple line graphs and descriptions in prose may be most helpful.

This section considers a range of approaches based on your understanding of the audience and the type of message you need to deliver.
