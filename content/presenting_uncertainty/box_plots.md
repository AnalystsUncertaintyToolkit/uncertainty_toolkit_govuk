Box plots can help the audience understand the underlying distribution of possible outcomes in more detail than just a range. Typically they show the median, interquartile range, maximum and minimum values for the range of possible outcomes. This can be particularly useful when the underlying distribution is skewed or non-normal.

Box plots can be arranged in parallel to show the distributions for a range of measures, and can help compare the different shapes.

Box plots may not be widely understood by non-analysts, so think carefully about whether the added information will be effective, or whether a simple range would be sufficient. Remember that most non analysts do not use the terms mean, median, inter quartile range frequently and may not know what they are. A labelled example can be used to help the audience interpret the format.

The graph depicts the percentage of individuals that die in their usual place of residence. Box plots are used to show the variation between different Clinical Commissioning Groups, and district and local authorities. A labelled box plot is presented to explain what the ranges mean.](/images/box_plots.png)
