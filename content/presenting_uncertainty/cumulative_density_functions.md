A cumulative density function shows similar information as a probability density function, but cumulatively. A CDF may be more helpful when the audience is primarily concerned with how likely it is that the value will be below (or above) a particular point (rather than the range within which we expect the value to fall). For example, how likely is it that our costs exceed our budget? Rather than, what are our costs going to be?

Labelling can be used to highlight the key features. However, features such as the mode are less clear on a CDF (shown by the steepest part of the graph), as they are harder to read by eye.

Example: [Change in Air Temperature for 2080-2099, Met Office (pdf)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18-guidance---how-to-use-the-cdf-and-pdf-plots.pdf). The graph shows the same information as the example in the [probability density functions]({{< ref "presenting_uncertainty/probability_density_functions">}}) section of the toolkit. The grey dotted lines indicate there is a 10% probability of a mean temperature change of less that 0.7C. The blue dotted line indicate that there is a 90% probability of a mean temperature change being less than 3.5C.
