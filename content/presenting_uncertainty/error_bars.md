Error bars can be added to bar graphs, line graphs and scatter graphs to illustrate a range around a central estimate, within which we expect the value to lie with a given probability. Be aware that a non analytical audience may be less familiar with error bars.

As referred to previously, consider the situation and decide on an appropriate level to display. E.g., don’t apply 95% confidence/prediction intervals by default. State what probability the error bars represent, and describe in prose how the viewer should ‘read’ the error bar.

Error bars can be added easily to a data series or time series. However, if the data are continuous (e.g. a time series) then consider whether showing multiple line graphs would be clearer than a single line graph with error bars.

If the output data are 2-dimensional, then you can apply error bars in 2 dimensions. Be careful to ensure that the resulting graph does not become illegible due to clutter.

For future emissions, vertical bars show uncertainty in the projections and indicate 95% confidence intervals for the uncertainties that have been modelled.](/images/error_bars.png)
