Fan charts can be used to show a series of different prediction intervals for time-series projections (e.g. 30%, 60% and 90% at the same time), illustrating how uncertainty changes over time. This is essentially plotting selected points from a time-dependent PDF.

Often a central ‘best estimate’ is not included, to avoid the viewer focussing on a single estimate and undermining the importance of the uncertainty

![Example: [CPI inflation projection, Bank of England (pdf)](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/inflation-report/2019/may/inflation-report-may-2019.pdf?la=en&hash=D4985F6D513BF04EB81A28C53F6DB0CFB8CC09FB). The graph depicts probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. The fan charts are constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within the darkest central band and each pair of the lighter red areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall anywhere outside the red area of the fan chart (grey area).](/images/fan_chart.png)
