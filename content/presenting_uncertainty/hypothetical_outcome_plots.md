Hypothetical outcome plots display possible outcomes as frames in an animation. This technique can make uncertainty more visceral and harder to ignore, while also providing an alternative to the typical markers of uncertainty.

Hypothetical outcomes are generated by drawing samples from a set of data in such a way that the samples could have resulted from the process that gave rise to the original data set (e.g. via bootstrapping). This technique can be applied to a range of data types and visualisations, for example regression lines with different gradients as determined by the variation in the data or a simple comparison of means like in the figure below.

Studies show that people are able to infer the distribution of data from the frequency of occurrences with surprising accuracy and therefore estimate likelihoods without needing prior knowledge of typical markers of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals, which non-analysts can find difficult to interpret. HOPs have also been shown to enable users to judge differences in probability between groups more accurately compared to error bars or violin plots. However, be aware that people can have difficulty inferring information such as the mean when variance is high. One way to overcome this is to include summary statistics with the plot.

Frame rate is an important design consideration. The animation must be sufficiently fast to allow the audience to view enough samples to reduce sampling error, but if too fast, the audience will not have time to register what they have seen. The addition of interactive controls can enable users to pause the animation or control the speed of frames.

Consider whether HOPs are the most appropriate choice for communicating uncertainty in your work as some formats might not easily support animation and especially if your analysis is likely to become part of printed material.

Example: [Hypothetical Outcome Plots: Experiencing the Uncertain](https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/hypothetical-outcomes-plots-experiencing-the-uncertain-b9ea60d7c740) 
How likely is it that B will be greater than A if more draws are taken? Error bars vs. HOPs. In the HOP, the lines tend to cluster around the mean, the most likely value, but show that more extreme values are still possible, albeit less likely.
