An interactive tool can help make analysis more accessible to non-specialists, assuming the non-specialists have the time to interact with the data. They can create an immersive experience that is easier for them to understand and is highly memorable. Note, that they often take longer to create and sometimes the key message may be lost.

Consider the overall message and where the uncertainties lie. Which aspects will the audience be interested in and what do they need to know? Remember with interactivity the user chooses what to look at. Will they find all your key messages in the tool or should these be highlighted somewhere? Use this understanding to bring focus to which interactive elements to create. The interactivity will enable your users to manipulate and get a deeper understanding of the message.
If a key source of uncertainty is a single variable, then it may be possible to construct a display that can be changed as the user adjusts the value of this variable by moving a slider. Or, if there are several key assumptions that impact the result a chart may be created that will change depending on the inputs that the user inserts.

Being able to see what would happen if an underlying assumption was to change is a powerful way to demonstrate the level of uncertainty in a given result.

![Example: The [DECC 2050 Calculator](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/2050-pathways-analysis) is an award-winning, user-friendly tool that helps users to explore the choices available to meet the 2050 carbon target. Whilst it doesnâ€™t explicitly cover the uncertainty in the underlying data it does allow the user to create their own set of policies to try to reach the target. This engaging tool was helpful in demonstrating to users how difficult some of the options are and the relative impact of each choice.](images/interactive.png)
