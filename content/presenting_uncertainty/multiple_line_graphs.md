Multiple line charts with time series data show a quantified range around a ‘most likely’ projection (essentially a series of error bars).

With scenario analysis, a series of line charts can be used to show the projections from each scenario. Generally, with scenario analysis each scenario should be presented with equal prominence, to avoid suggesting that one is more likely than another (unless analysis has been carried out to quantify the likelihoods of each).

Try to include an even number of scenarios, to avoid having a middle option that may be misinterpreted as the ‘most likely’ scenario.

![Example: [Employment Projections, OBR (pdf)](http://cdn.obr.uk/FSR-July-2018.pdf). The graph presents future employment levels for different demographic scenarios. Each scenario is represented by a separate line plot. The graph does not attempt to show the probability of each scenario occurring.](images/multiple_line.png)
