A probability density function can be used to give complete information on the range of possible outcomes, and the likelihood of each for a given estimate.

While presenting complete information may seem ideal, it may be more information than the audience actually needs. Would a prose description of the mean and range be sufficient? If the PDF is approximately normal, then there may be little value in displaying it, as the essential features can be described in a few words.

The distribution could be multimodal – for example the marks for students passing a university module may have a peak for a number who don’t study very hard, and a peak for those who worked really hard. In this case it could be misleading to present the mean, so a graphical illustration of the distribution may be more effective.

Labelling can be used to highlight the key features. It may aid clarity to draw the reader’s attention to important features, such as the mode.

If we need to communicate a series of PDFs, then multiple functions can be shown to compare the range of possible outcomes across the series. If there are only 2 or 3 these can be overlaid to make it easy to compare. With more, ‘small multiples’ are likely to be clearer.

Example: [Change in Air Temperature for 2080-2099, Met Office (pdf)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18-guidance---how-to-use-the-cdf-and-pdf-plots.pdf). The graph shows the expected change in air temperature in 2080-99 compared to 1981-2000 for a medium emission scenario.
