Violin plots are similar to box plots except they also show the probability density of possible outcomes, where a greater width means higher probability. This reinforces awareness of an underlying distribution and gives an intuitive sense of the distributionâ€™s shape, although it can be difficult to infer specific probability values.

Violin plots can help to avoid bias which can occur when interpreting intervals (for example when the uncertainty region is ignored in favour of the central tendency) or when reading error bars (for example within-the-bar-bias, common in bar charts). Within-the-bar bias occurs when viewers report that values are more likely to lie within the bar of a bar chart despite error bars indicating they could equally lie outside.

The audience might find interpretation of violin plots hard if they are unfamiliar with them. Weigh up the value added from the additional detail on uncertainty against the increased potential for audience confusion and consider what additional commentary should go alongside the plot to aid interpretation.

Example: [Collision probabilities of non-constellation spacecraft and constellation satellites, London Economics analysis for the UK Space Agency (pdf)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/917911/LE-UKSA_Commercial_Space_Surveillance_Tracking_FINAL_FOR_PUBLICATION.pdf). The graph shows how the collision probability for a subset of 216 non-constellation spacecraft and over 16,000 constellation satellites changes across the years 2020, 2025, 2029 and 2036.
