## Test the outputs of the uncertainty analysis

After modelling uncertainty, you should always test the outputs of the analysis before sharing the results. This minimises the risk of errors in your analysis and helps you to understand the detailed outputs fully, including the level of the extreme or the most likely values.

Uncertainty analysis may produce ‘extreme outcomes’, so that implausible results or scenarios are given. These can be identified through having a sensible checklist of validation rules (e.g. no negative values allowed) and aided with visualisation and filtering. These implausible outcomes could indicate an issue with the setup conditions of your analysis.

## Unusual results

Unusual results in uncertainty analysis may also indicate a weakness in how you have used your chosen technique. For example, if using the Monte Carlo technique, there may be unknown correlation which hasn’t been accounted for, or you might have used an inappropriate distribution for a parameter.

## Accounting for uncertainties that analysis cannot capture

One element you may not be able to test in your analysis is the effect of unknown system shocks, such as a recession. It is not always useful or practical to investigate and analyse these types of epistemic or ontological uncertainty, but they should be accounted for in presenting your analysis, for example by highlighting the risks associated with the analysis and the decision it will inform.
